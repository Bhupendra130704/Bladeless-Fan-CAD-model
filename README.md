# Bladeless Fan – Outer Body Design (SolidWorks)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the **SolidWorks CAD design of the outer body of a bladeless fan**, featuring a **perforated structure** similar to commercially available bladeless fans.  
The design focuses on aesthetics, airflow guidance, and manufacturability.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- To design the **outer casing** of a bladeless fan
- To study **perforated structures** used for airflow distribution
- To develop a **clean, manufacturable CAD model** suitable for prototyping

---

## 🛠 Design Tool
- **SolidWorks** (3D CAD modeling)

---

## 🧩 Design Features
- Circular outer body inspired by bladeless fan geometry
- Perforated structure for controlled air outlet
- Smooth internal airflow passage
- Symmetric and modular design
- Suitable for plastic manufacturing processes
